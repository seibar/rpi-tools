# Physical connections
- On the circuit you will notice the two leads are labeled "in" and "out."
- Connect the "out" lead to GPIO 23 and "in" lead to GPIO 24.
If you prefer to use other pins (e.g. GPIO 5 and 6) simply edit the script as discussed later in the setup. Do not connect to a ground or power GPIO pin. GPIO 0 and 1 can sometimes cause issues as well.

# Setup
- Run the setup script: `sudo bash setup.sh`
- Reboot `sudo reboot`
